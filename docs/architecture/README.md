# `docs/architecture/`

The architectural trail of this project. Updated continuously alongside the code.

## Layout

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`decisions/`](./decisions/) | **ADRs** — one file per architectural decision. Numbered, never deleted. Index below. |
| [`diagrams/`](./diagrams/) | **C4 diagrams** as Mermaid `.md` files (or sources alongside images). Context (L1), Container (L2), Component (L3) views. |
| [`research/`](./research/) | **Discovery and design notes** from `/archforge:discover` and `/archforge:design`. Snapshots of the problem space at the time of investigation. |
| [`reviews/`](./reviews/) | **Architectural reviews** from `/archforge:review`. Reviews of substantial changesets, kept for posterity. |

The root [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) is the living high-level document. ADRs and diagrams here are the artifacts that produced it.

## How to use

- New architectural decision → `/archforge:cycle "<problem>"` (full process) or `/archforge:adr "<decision>"` (shortcut).
- Need a diagram → `/archforge:c4 <level> "<subject>"`.
- Architectural review of a PR or directory → `/archforge:review [path]`.
- Just looking around → start with [`../../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../ARCHITECTURE.md), then drill into ADRs.

ADRs are append-only. Decisions that no longer hold are not edited — they're superseded by a new ADR. This preserves the history of how the team's thinking evolved.
